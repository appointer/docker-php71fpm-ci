# docker-php71fpm-ci
This is the Dockerfile for the docker image used in our CircleCI builds. It ships a PHP 7.1 FPM with several things pre-installed (nodejs, yarn, composer).
You may also look at the pushed docker build on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/appointer/php71fpm-ci/).

This is highly work in progress and just a first draft that has been created in a tiny amount of time. So please use with caution.
